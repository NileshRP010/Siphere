Siphere is a decentralized platform built on the Solana blockchain that enables users to automate long-term crypto investing through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), integrating staking, lending, and optional insurance for enhanced risk protection.

## Overview

Autovest brings the discipline of traditional SIP investing into crypto. It allows users to invest stablecoins or SOL at regular intervals into on-chain strategies like staking and lending, helping them build wealth over time without market timing stress. The platform is fully non-custodial, transparent, and integrates insurance logic to provide a safety net for protocol risk and execution failure.

## Features

- Create SIPs with stablecoins or SOL (weekly/monthly)
- Yield generation via staking or DeFi lending
- Optional insurance against protocol failure and missed execution
- Real-time analytics dashboard and activity logs
- User profile with yield history, insurance stats, and behavioral analytics
- Non-custodial, wallet-based investment

## How It Works

1. Connect your wallet and set your SIP (amount, frequency, strategy).
2. Platform auto-executes swaps and deposits based on your strategy.
3. Funds are invested into whitelisted staking or lending protocols.
4. Optional insurance provides protection during protocol failure or missed automation.
5. Track your investments and returns in the live dashboard.
